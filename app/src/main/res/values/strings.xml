Afterwards exit through the back button and press Play Gameto start a game. Your goal is to find all the hidden Rebels with the least amount of scans. You trigger a scan when you click a button and There is no Rebel there. The scan checks for Rebels in its row and column and the number it shows is the amount of rebels within its row and column. If the button has a hidden Rebel it won\'t trigger a scan but you can click on it afterwards to trigger a scan. The game tracks your total scans and hidden rebels first. Once you find all the hidden rebels you win!</string>
